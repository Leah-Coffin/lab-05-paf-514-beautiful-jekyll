My name is L. Coffin. A little about my experiences:

- I started my career as a teacher and taught for close to ten years.
- I moved overseas for 7 years and worked in the nonprofit sector while getting my Masters in Family Studies.
- I am now back in the States working on a Masters in Program Evaluation and Data Analytics.
- I become obsessed about acquiring new skills.
